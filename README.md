# Text_Generation

**Text Classification with LSTM and Keras**
This repository contains a simple implementation of text classification using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network built with Keras. The model is trained on a dummy dataset and can be used as a starting point for building more complex text classification tasks.


**Prerequisites**

Python 3.x
Keras
NumPy
Pickle

**Getting Started**

Clone the repository:
```

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
```


Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd your-repo
```


Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install keras numpy
```

## Usage

Open the Python script text_classification.py in your preferred editor.
Replace the dummy texts list with your actual text data.
Modify the max_sequence_length variable to match the desired maximum length of your input sequences.
Adjust the hyperparameters of the LSTM model, such as the embedding dimension, LSTM units, and activation function, according to your requirements.
Run the script to train the model:

```
python txtgen.ipynb
```


After training, the model will be saved as model.h5 in the path_to_save_model directory, and the tokenizer will be saved as tokenizer.pkl in the path_to_save_tokenizer directory.

**Model Architecture**
The model consists of the following layers:

Embedding Layer: This layer maps each word in the input sequences to a dense vector representation.
LSTM Layer: This layer processes the sequence of embedded word vectors and captures the long-term dependencies in the data.
Dense Layer: This layer performs the final classification task by mapping the LSTM output to a single value between 0 and 1 (sigmoid activation).

**Customization**

Adjust the hyperparameters of the model (e.g., embedding dimension, LSTM units, activation function) to suit your specific task.
Modify the loss function and metrics according to your classification problem (e.g., categorical_crossentropy for multi-class classification).
Implement additional preprocessing steps, such as text cleaning, stopword removal, or stemming/lemmatization, as required by your data.
Explore different model architectures, such as using bidirectional LSTMs, attention mechanisms, or combining LSTMs with convolutional layers.
